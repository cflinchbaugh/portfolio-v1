                        With a background in Computer Science, Art, and Psychology, I found my calling as a UI/UX Developer. I focus on creating experiences with clear purpose and both intuitive and enjoyable interfaces that bring delight.

                    <p>
                        Between dev-times you can find me studying Japanese, listening to lo-fi while sketching, or putting off my backlog of games in favor of some exercise.
                    </p>
                </div>
