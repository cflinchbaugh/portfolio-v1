        loved: 'Loved: This is my favorite project so far, it\'s fleshed out and has a lot of potential to grow.  The idea came from when I was first learning Japanese and was writing flashcards. I wanted to be able to reference all the different versions of a word (English/Romaji/Hiragana/Katakana/Kanji) without having to cover up part of the card, and since a real notecard only has two sides- that was difficult to do.',

Not only did I learn a lot about client interaction, but I was able to see their joy when the project wrapped.  Configuring and deploying the website was also a profound learning experience because it helped me see how much more goes on beyond the parts of a project I am most intimately involved with at the office.',
