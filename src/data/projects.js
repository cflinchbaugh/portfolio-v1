      "Learnolotl is a web-app I wrote to study Japanese. When I was first learning Japanese, I wanted to be able to reference all the different versions of a word (English/Romaji/Hiragana/Katakana/Kanji) on a single, hand-written flashcard.  Since a real notecard only has two sides, that was difficult to do.  I set out to solve that single problem and planned out the project with multiple milestones, a style guide, and an in-depth readme.",
    learned:
      "Before I started this project, I had little experience working with React.  Throughout, I learned a lot from the official documentation and after my hands-on experience grew, I was able to demonstrate the benefits the framework has over the BackboneJS framework (including memory management concerns, rapid development time, and improved performance).  When my employers were considering new frameworks, I provided demos of the differences and observations which informed our next steps as a team and lead to adopting React for new projects.",
    loved:
      "This is my favorite project so far because it is something that I use frequently.  I love that it's fleshed out enough to solve the original problem yet still has a lot of potential to grow.  Going through the exercise of branding it, creating a style guide, and designing a logo was also a real treat and gave me the opportunity to implement more art and design than many of my other projects.",

    description:
      "I founded and led a bi-weekly guild designed for engineers of all levels to collaboratively define company best practices, explore and adopt new relevant technologies, and develop impactful internal projects.  The guild fostered a thriving environment of engagement, collaboration, and innovation.  Its success not only optimized developer workflows and raised the quality of our codebase(s), but also established a culture of shared ownership and continuous improvement.  This initiative was so impactful that additional guilds for other domains were created using the roadmap and structure I designed, further enhancing company-wide standards and cross-team alignment.",
    learned:
      "Founding a guild from scratch provided me with invaluable experience navigating both technical and non-technical challenges.  I focused on identifying needs, specifically I began by understanding the target audience and addressing key pain points in processes, collaboration, and knowledge gaps.  I then fostered engagment by developing strategies to maintain consistent participation via actionable content, promoting open discussion, and recognizing individual contributions.  I promoted collaboration and encouraged teamwork through initiatives that invited engineers to co-lead sessions, present technical ideas, and contribute to impactful decisions.  As the guild became more established I then focused on expanding leadership by defining metrics for success and introducing a panel of three co-leadrs to diversify perspectives, manage workloads more sustainably, and ensure inclusive decision-making.  These experiences refined my leadership skills even further and improved my communication, adapatbility, and insight into crafting a more aligned organization.",
    loved:
      "Leading the guild was one of the most fulfilling experiences of my career.  I particularly enjoyed empowering others and witnessing the professional growth of team members as they gained confidence, learned new technologies, and became more well-rounded with full-stack capabilities.  Seeing tangible impact from the guild's efforts, such as improved productivity, more robust and scalable code, better test coverage, and more cross-functional alignment lead to faster project development cycles was especially rewarding.  Creating a legacy as I watched the guild's roadmap inspire the formation of additional specialized guilds, further driving innovation and collaboration, is a true career highlight that will forever remain incredibly rewarding.",

      "This was a website I designed and coded for a local business to help unify their branding and improve their web presence.  They were looking to show each professional as an individual with their own specialties and prices, but also provide cohesion to reflect how closely they work together.  To achieve this, I focused on separating each person and providing them a card with their details while directing focus to groupshots and and increased the use of their branding colors to provide unity.",
    learned:
      "I have experience working with clients through my profession, but this project allowed me to be the direct point of contact for every step of the process.  I was responsible of the entire project, so I was able to put my full skillset to use and work with the client to identify problems, provide recommendations, create designs, gather feedback, develop the final code, and deploy it.  Standing up a website is not something I regularly do, so there were many opportunities to gain experience throughout the deployment process.",

      "At this point in my career this was the most rewarding work I had done because I was able to interact with the client, see their joy when the project wrapped, and have signficant impact on their business by driving engagement and increasing their client-base.

      "Through CodePen I've gained experience using CSS pseudo-elements like ::after to reduce my reliance on divs and other HTML tags that can sometimes clutter the DOM, improving code clarity and maintainability.
